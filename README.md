# physical-chemistry-experiment-reports

E-reports for 'Physical Chemistry Experiment II' course of Nanjing University, written in Latex.

## This repo now includes:
1. Lab15: gamma-Al2O3 catalyst 
2. lab16: TiO2 photocatalysis
3. Lab17: Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction 
4. Lab20: electrodynamic potential
5. Lab28: dipole moment 
6. Extended experiment: electronic conductivity 
7. A python notebook for experimental data linear curve fitting 

## Next step:
1. Correctify chemical formula typing.
2. Fix some other bugs if discovered.
3. Collect more e-reports from NJUers.

## Ackowledgements: 

**Students willing to provide other experiment e-reports are welcomed.**
